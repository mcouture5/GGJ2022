# GGJ2022
Global Game Jam 2022 Fpoons

## Setup Instructions
We are using Typescript with webpack. You must have a server running to view the game, phaser does not transfer files over a file based webpage.

## 1) Checkout source
Clone the repo to your machine. `git clone https://github.com/mcouture5/GGJ2022.git`

## 1) Install dependencies
`npm install` in the main folder.

## 2) Run dev build
The dev webpack build will auto build whenever changes are made. No need to rebuild and crap.

`npm run dev`
